Airplanes come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and wing configurations.
The broad spectrum of uses for airplanes includes recreation, transportation of goods and people, military, and research.
Most airplanes are flown by a pilot on board the aircraft, but some are designed to be remotely or computer-controlled such as drones.
