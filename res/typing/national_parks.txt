A national park is a natural park in use for conservation purposes, created and protected by national governments.
Often it is a reserve of natural, semi-natural, or developed land that a government declares or owns.
Although individual countries designate their own national parks differently, there is a common idea: the conservation of 'wild nature' for posterity and as a symbol of national pride.
National parks are almost always open to visitors.
