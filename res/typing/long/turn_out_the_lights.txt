There's a hole in the drywall still not fixed
I just haven't gotten around to it
And besides, I'm starting to get used to the gaps
Say you wish you could find some way to help
To be so hard on myself
So why is it easy for everyone else?
I'm not always like this
There's always tomorrow, I guess
And I'd never do it, but it's not a joke
I can't tell the difference when I'm all alone
Is it real or a dream? Which is worse?
Can you help me?
I just wanted to go to sleep
When I turn out the lights
There's no one left
Between myself and me
But when I turn out the lights
When I turn out the lights
When I turn out the lights, oh
There's no one left
Between myself and me
